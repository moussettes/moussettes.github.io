      <pre>
      [C] I went to the [G] store today
      [Am] Just to buy a [F] little more
      [C] But I lost my [G] way again
      [Am] Got caught in a [F] memory storm

      [F] Oh, I [C] need you now
      [G] Can't stop thinking [Am] about how
      [F] You make me feel [C] alive
      [G] Together, we'll [Am] survive

      [C] Walking down the [G] road again
      [Am] I find my way back [F] home

      [Am] The one I'll never [F] outgrow
